    <p> Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen are two of the most prominent and successful drivers in Formula 1 racing. They have been fierce competitors and have engaged in intense battles on the track. </p>
    <p>Lewis Hamilton, a British driver, made his Formula 1 debut in 2007 with McLaren. He quickly established himself as a talented driver and won his first World Championship in 2008. Hamilton then moved to the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team in 2013, where he enjoyed tremendous success. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Hamilton had won a record-breaking seven World Championships, matching the legendary Michael Schumacher's achievement. Hamilton is known for his exceptional skill, consistency, and ability to adapt to changing race conditions.

        Max Verstappen, a Dutch driver, entered Formula 1 in 2015 with Toro Rosso (now AlphaTauri). He became the youngest driver ever to start a Formula 1 race at the age of 17. Verstappen's aggressive driving style and remarkable performances quickly garnered attention, and in 2016 he moved to Red Bull Racing, where he continued to impress. Verstappen has established himself as one of the top drivers in the sport, showcasing his exceptional talent, racecraft, and overtaking skills.
        
        The rivalry between Hamilton and Verstappen intensified in recent years as they battled for victories and championships. In the 2021 season, they had several thrilling duels on the track, resulting in some controversial incidents and collisions. Their rivalry captured the attention of fans worldwide and added an extra layer of excitement to the sport.
        
        However, please note that my knowledge is based on information available up until September 2021, and there may have been significant developments or changes in their careers since then.</p>
